# discord-game-template

This is a template for creating a game module for our discord bot Dijkstra-Chan.</br>
Add your game description and rules here!

To help you write the code for your game, you can take the example of our [Connect-4 game](https://github.com/INSAlgo/Concours-Puissance4).</br>
Don't forget to make AI templates (especially the python one) to help your players make their AIs!

Also update the metadata in `__init__.py`.
